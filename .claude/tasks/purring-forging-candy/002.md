# Task: Create tasks route directory structure

## Description
Create the directory structure for the `routes/tasks/` module with initial scaffolding files.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Directory `crates/server/src/routes/tasks/` created
- [ ] Directory `crates/server/src/routes/tasks/handlers/` created
- [ ] Index.md documentation files created in both directories
- [ ] Skeleton mod.rs files created
- [ ] `cargo check -p server` passes

## Technical Details
- Follow pattern from existing `task_attempts/` and `projects/` directories
- Create empty handler re-exports initially
- Router will be migrated in a later task

## Directory Structure
```
crates/server/src/routes/tasks/
├── Index.md
├── mod.rs
├── types.rs
└── handlers/
    ├── Index.md
    └── mod.rs
```

## Files to Create
- crates/server/src/routes/tasks/Index.md
- crates/server/src/routes/tasks/mod.rs
- crates/server/src/routes/tasks/handlers/Index.md
- crates/server/src/routes/tasks/handlers/mod.rs

## Dependencies
- None

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] Index.md files document the module purpose
- [ ] Skeleton mod.rs files compile
- [ ] Clippy passes
