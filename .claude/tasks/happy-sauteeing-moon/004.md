# Task: Write test_reject_if_remote_returns_not_found

## Description
Write the third test case that verifies the `reject_if_remote` helper function correctly returns `NotFound` when the task_attempt references a non-existent task.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test `test_reject_if_remote_returns_not_found_for_missing_task` added to test module
- [ ] Test creates a fake TaskAttempt struct with a non-existent task_id
- [ ] Test verifies `reject_if_remote` returns `Err(ApiError::NotFound(_))`
- [ ] Test FAILS to compile initially (function doesn't exist yet - RED phase)

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create a TaskAttempt struct manually with a random UUID as task_id
- Key considerations:
  - Need to understand TaskAttempt struct fields to construct a valid instance
  - The fake attempt doesn't need to be in the database
- Code locations/files affected: `crates/server/src/routes/message_queue.rs` (tests module)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - test module structure must exist

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test code written
- [ ] Test fails to compile (expected - function doesn't exist yet)
