# Task: Wire Tracker Through WebSocket Handler

## Description
Pass the tracker from AppState through the WebSocket handler chain so it's available for backfill response handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update `mod.rs` to get tracker from state and pass to `handle()`
- [ ] Update `session.rs` `handle()` signature to accept `tracker: Arc<BackfillRequestTracker>`
- [ ] Pass tracker through to `handle_backfill_response()` when processing messages

## Technical Details
- Location: `crates/remote/src/nodes/ws/mod.rs` and `session.rs`
- In mod.rs: get tracker via `state.backfill_tracker()`
- Add import for BackfillRequestTracker in both files

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 006 - handle_backfill_response must accept tracker

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5

## Definition of Done
- [ ] mod.rs passes tracker to handle()
- [ ] session.rs handle() accepts tracker
- [ ] Tracker flows through to response handler
- [ ] `cargo check -p remote` passes
