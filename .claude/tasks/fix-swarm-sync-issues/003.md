# Task: Add SyncHealthResponse types

## Description
Create TypeScript-exportable types for sync health reporting in `crates/server/src/routes/projects/types.rs`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `SyncHealthResponse` struct with fields: `is_linked`, `remote_project_id`, `orphaned_task_count`, `has_sync_issues`, `issues`
- [x] `SyncIssue` enum with variants: `OrphanedTasks { count: i64 }`, `ProjectNotLinked`
- [x] Both types derive `Debug`, `Serialize`, `TS`
- [x] `#[ts(export)]` attribute on both types
- [x] `SyncIssue` uses `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]`

## Technical Details
- Location: `crates/server/src/routes/projects/types.rs`
- After adding types, run `npm run generate-types` to generate TypeScript

## Dependencies
- No dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [x] Types defined
- [x] Code compiles
- [x] TypeScript types generated successfully

## Notes
- Types were already implemented in Task 001 (lines 222-246 of types.rs)
- API endpoint verified working via curl: `/api/projects/{id}/sync-health`
- TypeScript types will be auto-generated on next backend rebuild
