# Task: Create unlink request/response types

## Description
Add request and response types for the unlink-from-swarm endpoint in `crates/server/src/routes/projects/types.rs`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `UnlinkSwarmRequest` struct with field: `notify_hive: bool`
- [x] `UnlinkSwarmResponse` struct with fields: `tasks_unlinked: u64`, `attempts_reset: u64`, `hive_notified: bool`
- [x] Both types derive `Debug`, `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `TS`
- [x] `#[ts(export)]` on both types
- [x] TypeScript types generated successfully

## Technical Details
- Location: `crates/server/src/routes/projects/types.rs`
- Run `npm run generate-types` after adding

## Dependencies
- No dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25

## Definition of Done
- [x] Types defined
- [x] Code compiles
- [x] TypeScript types generated
