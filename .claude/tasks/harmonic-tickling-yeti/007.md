# Task: Implement Batched Log Entry Deletion

## Description
Replace single DELETE query with batched deletion for log entries to prevent long database locks on large purge operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `delete_older_than` function rewritten to use batched deletes
- [ ] Batch size set to 10,000 rows
- [ ] 10ms yield between batches implemented
- [ ] Function returns total deleted count
- [ ] Clear documentation added

## Technical Details
- File: crates/db/src/models/log_entry/cleanup.rs
- Use loop with DELETE IN (SELECT ... LIMIT 10000)
- Add tokio::time::sleep(10ms) between batches
- Track total_deleted across iterations
- Import: `use std::time::Duration as StdDuration;`

## Dependencies
- None

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Batched delete implemented
- [ ] SQLx cache regenerated
- [ ] Unit test added
- [ ] `cargo clippy` passes
- [ ] `cargo test -p db` passes
- [ ] Changes committed
