- [ ] Errors logged but don't fail execution
- [ ] Tracing logs repair attempts
- [ ] Code compiles and tests pass

## Technical Details
In crates/executors/src/executors/claude.rs:

```rust
async fn spawn_follow_up(
    &self,
    current_dir: &Path,
    prompt: &str,
    session_id: &str,
) -> Result<SpawnedChild, ExecutorError> {
    // Repair sessions-index.json if needed
    if let Err(e) = session_index::repair_sessions_index(current_dir).await {
        tracing::warn!(error = %e, "Failed to repair sessions index, continuing");
    }
    // ... existing code
}
```
