# Fix: Organizations Settings Page Not Loading

## Status: needs-review

## Completed Items
- [x] Identified root cause: `Tooltip` components used without `TooltipProvider` wrapper
- [x] Updated `NodeApiKeySection.tsx` to wrap both Tooltip usages with TooltipProvider
- [x] Ran `npm run check` - all checks passed (TypeScript + Rust)
- [x] Started dev server and tested in browser
- [x] Verified page loads without TooltipProvider error
- [x] Tested in mobile (375x812), tablet (768x1024), and desktop (1440x900) dimensions
- [x] Tested dark mode functionality
- [x] Verified no console errors related to TooltipProvider

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/components/org/NodeApiKeySection.tsx`
  - Wrapped "Bound" badge Tooltip (lines 351-363) with TooltipProvider
  - Wrapped "Blocked" badge Tooltip (lines 388-414) with TooltipProvider

## Bug Fixed
- **Error**: `Tooltip must be used within TooltipProvider`
- **Location**: `/settings/organizations` page on nodes
- **Cause**: Two Tooltip usages in NodeApiKeySection.tsx were missing TooltipProvider wrappers
- **Solution**: Added TooltipProvider wrapper around each Tooltip, following the established pattern used in 20+ other components in the codebase

## Testing Performed
1. **Build Verification**: `npm run check` passed with no errors
2. **Browser Testing**:
   - Page loads without crash at `/settings/organizations`
   - No TooltipProvider errors in console
   - Tested on localhost:19010 with dev server
3. **Responsive Testing**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports all render correctly
4. **Theme Testing**: Light and dark modes work correctly

## Validation Results
- TypeScript compilation: PASS
- Rust cargo check: PASS
- ESLint: PASS (implicit in npm run check)
- Browser testing: PASS - no TooltipProvider errors

## Remaining Work
- None - fix is complete

## Next Steps
- Ready for PR/merge after code review
- Session 2 can perform regression testing on other nodes as outlined in the plan
