# Process Management Feature - Progress

## Status: needs-review

## Session 4 (Complete)

### Goal
Create ProcessService with association logic for discovering and managing vibe-kanban processes.

### Completed Items
- [x] Created `ProcessService` struct with generic `ProcessInspector` parameter
  - Uses `Arc<I>` for shared ownership, implements `Clone`
  - Generic over `ProcessInspector` trait for testability
- [x] Implemented `ProcessInfo` struct with vibe-kanban association context
  - All fields from `RawProcessInfo` plus: execution_process_id, task_attempt_id, task_id, project_id, project_name, task_title, is_executor
  - Helper methods `from_raw()` and `with_association()` for construction
  - Created `ProcessAssociation` struct to avoid too-many-arguments clippy warning
- [x] Implemented `ProcessFilter` struct for list filtering
  - Supports filtering by project_id, task_id, task_attempt_id
  - `executors_only` flag to filter to only executor processes
- [x] Implemented `KillScope` enum for kill operation targeting
  - Variants: Single { pid }, Task { task_id }, Project { project_id }, AllExceptExecutors, All
  - Uses tagged serde serialization for TypeScript discriminated unions
- [x] Implemented `KillResult` and `KillFailure` structs for operation results
- [x] Implemented `list_processes()` method
  - Loads running execution processes from DB via `find_running_with_pids()`
  - Builds associations by querying TaskAttempt, Task, Project for each execution
  - For each executor PID: finds executor process, gets process tree descendants, finds processes by worktree cwd
  - Deduplicates by PID, applies filters
- [x] Implemented `kill_processes()` method
  - Handles single PID directly
  - For scoped kills: lists processes, optionally filters executors, kills in reverse PID order
  - Counts successes/failures, returns detailed result
- [x] Implemented `load_execution_associations()` helper to load DB context
- [x] Added module export to `crates/services/src/services/mod.rs`
- [x] Generated TypeScript types (ProcessInfo, ProcessFilter, KillScope, KillResult, KillFailure)
- [x] All 13 ProcessService unit tests pass
- [x] Clippy passes with no warnings

## Session 3 (Complete)

### Goal
Database migration + PID storage: Store the system PID of spawned execution processes to enable process tree discovery.

### Completed Items
- [x] Synced with origin/main via rebase
- [x] Created migration `20251219131409_add_pid_to_execution_processes.sql`
  - Adds `pid INTEGER` column to `execution_processes` table
  - Creates index `idx_execution_processes_pid_running` for efficient lookups on running processes
- [x] Updated `ExecutionProcess` model with `pid: Option<i64>` field
  - Added field to struct definition with documentation comment
  - Updated all 9 SELECT queries to include the new `pid` column
  - Updated INSERT query to include `pid` (defaults to NULL)
- [x] Added `ExecutionProcess::update_pid()` method for updating PID after spawn
- [x] Added `ExecutionProcess::find_running_with_pids()` query for process tree discovery
- [x] Modified `LocalContainerService::start_execution_inner()` to:
  - Extract PID from `AsyncGroupChild` using `spawned.child.inner().id()`
  - Store PID in database via `ExecutionProcess::update_pid()`
  - Added debug logging for PID storage
  - Added warning logging for failed PID storage (non-fatal)
- [x] Generated TypeScript types with new `pid` field
- [x] Ran SQLx prepare-db to update query cache
- [x] All 11 ProcessInspector integration tests pass
- [x] Clippy passes with no warnings on modified packages

### Files Created
- `crates/db/migrations/20251219131409_add_pid_to_execution_processes.sql`

### Files Modified
- `crates/db/src/models/execution_process.rs`
- `crates/local-deployment/src/container.rs`
- `shared/types.ts` (auto-generated)
- `crates/db/.sqlx/*.json` (auto-generated cache files)

### Notes
- The `remote` crate has pre-existing SQLx compilation issues related to `organization_member_metadata` table - these are unrelated to this feature and should be addressed separately
- Pre-existing formatting inconsistencies in the codebase were not modified to keep changes focused

## Session 2 (Complete)

### Goal
Implement `SysinfoProcessInspector` for Linux/macOS using `sysinfo` crate with integration tests.

### Completed Items
- [x] Created `SysinfoProcessInspector` implementation (`crates/services/src/services/process_inspector/sysinfo_impl.rs`)
  - Uses `sysinfo::System` to query real process information
  - Implements all `ProcessInspector` trait methods:
    - `list_processes()` - Returns all system processes with PID, name, command, cwd, memory, CPU
    - `get_process_tree()` - BFS traversal to find all descendants of a given PID
    - `find_processes_by_cwd_prefix()` - Finds processes running in a specific directory
    - `kill_process()` - Sends SIGTERM (force=false) or SIGKILL (force=true)
    - `process_exists()` - Checks if a process with given PID exists

## Remaining Work (Session 5+)
- [ ] Session 5: Add API endpoint for process tree data (GET/POST /api/processes)
- [ ] Session 6: Build frontend ProcessTree component
- [ ] Session 7: Kill operations + confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Session 8: Testing + edge cases + polish

## Next Session Recommendations
Session 5 should add API routes:
1. Create `crates/server/src/routes/processes.rs` with handlers
2. Implement `GET /api/processes` - List processes with optional filters
3. Implement `POST /api/processes/kill` - Kill processes by scope
4. Register routes in `crates/server/src/routes/mod.rs`
5. Add `ProcessServiceError` mapping in `crates/server/src/error.rs`
