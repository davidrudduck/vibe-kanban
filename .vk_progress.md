## Technical Notes

- Backup files are stored in `dev_assets/backups/` directory
- Filenames follow pattern: `db_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sqlite`
- `size_bytes` is typed as `u64` in Rust, `bigint` in TypeScript
- API response uses standard `ApiResponse<T>` wrapper
- Download uses file streaming with `ReaderStream` and `Body::from_stream`
- Upload uses multipart form data with 500MB body limit
- Restore validates SQLite header (first 16 bytes must be "SQLite format 3\0")
- Restore creates automatic backup before replacing database
- Restore removes WAL/SHM files to force clean database state
