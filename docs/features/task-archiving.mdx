Archiving tasks allows you to remove completed or inactive tasks from your active board view while preserving their history. Archived tasks can be restored at any time.

## Overview

Task archiving provides:
- **Clean boards** - Remove clutter by hiding completed tasks
- **History preservation** - Archived tasks retain all their data, attempts, and logs
- **Reversibility** - Unarchive tasks to bring them back to active status
- **Automatic cleanup** - Worktrees are cleaned up when tasks are archived

## Archiving Tasks

### From the Task Card

1. Click the **Archive** button on any task card
2. Optionally select "Include subtasks" to archive all child tasks
3. Confirm the archive operation

### What Happens When You Archive

When a task is archived:
1. The `archived_at` timestamp is set
2. The task is hidden from the default board view
3. Worktrees associated with the task's attempts are cleaned up in the background
4. Subtasks can optionally be archived together

<Note>
Worktree cleanup happens asynchronously. The archive operation returns immediately while cleanup continues in the background.
</Note>

## Viewing Archived Tasks

To view archived tasks:

1. Click the filter/settings icon on your board
2. Enable "Show Archived Tasks"
3. Archived tasks appear with a visual indicator

## Unarchiving Tasks

To restore an archived task:

1. View archived tasks (see above)
2. Click the **Unarchive** button on the archived task
3. The task returns to its previous status column

<Note>
Unarchiving a task does not restore worktrees. You'll need to start a new attempt if you want to continue working on the task.
</Note>

## Hive-Synced Task Archiving

For tasks that are synced with a hive (swarm tasks), archiving behavior is slightly different.

### How It Works

When you archive a hive-synced task:
1. The archive request is proxied to the hive server
2. The hive updates the task's `archived_at` field
3. The change syncs to all connected nodes
4. All nodes see the task as archived

This means:
- **Any node can archive** - You don't need to be on the "origin" node
- **Changes sync everywhere** - Archive status propagates to all connected nodes
- **Consistent state** - All nodes see the same archive status

### Subtask Handling

For hive-synced tasks, the hive handles subtask archiving:
- When you archive a parent task on the hive, child tasks are also archived
- This happens on the server side, so you don't need to manually select "Include subtasks"
- Archive status of subtasks syncs to all nodes

### Technical Details

The archive operation uses the same `UpdateSharedTaskRequest` API that handles other task updates:

```rust
// Archive request
UpdateSharedTaskRequest {
    archived_at: Some(Some(Utc::now())),  // Set archive timestamp
    ...
}

// Unarchive request
UpdateSharedTaskRequest {
    archived_at: Some(None),  // Clear archive timestamp
    ...
}
```

This ensures:
- Version tracking for conflict resolution
- Proper sync with all connected nodes
- Consistent behavior with other task updates

## Best Practices

### When to Archive

- **Completed tasks** - After merging a PR and closing the task
- **Cancelled tasks** - Tasks that won't be worked on
- **Old tasks** - Tasks that have been dormant for a long time

### When Not to Archive

- **Tasks in active development** - This will clean up worktrees
- **Tasks you might resume soon** - Consider using status columns instead

### Organizing with Archive

1. **Regular cleanup** - Periodically archive completed tasks
2. **Use filters** - Enable archived view only when you need to find old tasks
3. **Subtask consideration** - Decide if subtasks should be archived together

## Troubleshooting

### "Task has running execution processes"

You cannot archive a task while it has running processes. Either:
- Wait for the processes to complete
- Stop the running processes first
- Check the Processes panel for active executions

### "Cannot archive remote task" (Legacy)

This error occurred in older versions when trying to archive hive-synced tasks. As of v0.0.125, this is no longer an issue - all tasks can be archived from any node.

### Worktree Not Cleaned Up

If a worktree wasn't cleaned up after archiving:
1. Check the server logs for cleanup errors
2. Manually clean up the worktree directory if needed
3. The worktree path is stored in the task attempt record
