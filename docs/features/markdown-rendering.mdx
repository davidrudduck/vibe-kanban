Vibe Kanban renders markdown content throughout the application, including task descriptions, conversation messages, and notes. This document covers the supported syntax, known behaviors, and workarounds.

## Supported Markdown Syntax

The markdown renderer supports **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)** and **CommonMark** syntax:

| Feature | Syntax | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Bold | `**text**` | **bold text** |
| Italic | `_text_` (with spaces) | _italic text_ |
| Inline code | `` `code` `` | `code` |
| Code blocks | ` ``` ` fenced | Syntax highlighted |
| Links | `[text](url)` | External links open in new tab |
| Images | `![alt](url)` | Thumbnail with lightbox |
| Headings | `# H1` to `###### H6` | Hierarchical sizing |
| Lists | `- item` or `1. item` | Bullet or numbered |

## Underscore Handling

Variable names like `VK_DATABASE_PATH` or `snake_case` render correctly without italic formatting.

### How It Works

The preprocessor escapes underscores that appear **between** word characters:

| Input | Output | Rendering |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| `VK_DATABASE_PATH` | `VK\_DATABASE\_PATH` | VK_DATABASE_PATH |
| `snake_case` | `snake\_case` | snake_case |
| `_italic_` (with spaces) | `_italic_` | _italic_ |

### Rules

1. **Underscores between word characters are escaped** - Prevents snake_case from becoming italic
2. **Underscores with surrounding spaces are preserved** - ` _text_ ` renders as italic
3. **Code blocks are preserved** - No escaping inside backticks or fenced blocks
4. **URLs are preserved** - Underscores in URLs remain unchanged

### Examples

```markdown
# These render WITHOUT italic:
- VK_DATABASE_PATH (environment variable)
- connection_token_service (identifier)
- one_two_three_four (multiple underscores)

# This renders WITH italic:
- This is _italic_ text (spaces around underscores)

# These are preserved:
- `snake_case` (inline code)
- https://example.com/path_with_underscores (URL)
```

## Code Blocks

### Inline Code

Inline code uses backticks and displays with a subtle background:

```markdown
Use the `preprocessMarkdown` function.
```

### Fenced Code Blocks

Fenced code blocks have a visible border and background for clear visual separation:

```markdown
```rust
fn main() {
    let token = "test";
    println!("Hello!");
}
```
```bash

Code blocks preserve:
- Original formatting and indentation
- Underscore characters (no escaping)
- Language-specific syntax (for highlighting)

## Heading Hierarchy

Headings render with clear visual hierarchy:

| Level | Font Size | Weight |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `# H1` | xl (20px) | semibold |
| `## H2` | lg (18px) | semibold |
| `### H3` | base (16px) | semibold |
| `#### H4` | base (16px) | medium |
| `##### H5` | sm (14px) | semibold |
| `###### H6` | sm (14px) | medium |

## Links

### External Links

Links to external URLs (https://) open in a new tab with security attributes:

```markdown
See [React docs](https://react.dev) for more info.
```

### Internal Links

Relative paths, anchors, and non-https URLs are displayed as disabled links (styled but not clickable) to prevent navigation issues within the app.

## Images

Images render as thumbnails with a hover effect. Clicking an image opens a lightbox for full-size viewing.

### .vibe-images Support

Images in task `.vibe-images/` directories are automatically resolved and displayed. The lightbox supports navigating between all images attached to a task.

## Disabled Features

### Mark/Highlight Syntax

The `==highlight==` syntax is disabled. Text wrapped in double equals signs renders as plain text instead of highlighted (yellow background).

**Why?** Technical content often contains patterns like `================` separators that would otherwise trigger unwanted highlighting.

## Troubleshooting

### Italic Appearing Where Not Expected

If text appears italic unexpectedly, check for underscores that might be interpreted as markdown:

- **Workaround**: Wrap in backticks (`` `like_this` ``) to render as code
- **Pattern**: Underscores need word characters on **both** sides to be escaped

### Variables Not Rendering Correctly

If environment variables or identifiers show italic sections:

1. Check that there are no spaces between underscores and words
2. Verify the text isn't inside a quote or special context
3. Use inline code for guaranteed correct rendering: `` `VK_DATABASE_PATH` ``

### Code Blocks Not Distinct

If code blocks blend into surrounding text:

- Code blocks should have a visible border and background
- If not visible, check theme settings or CSS customizations
